## Idea: What if an LLM asked questions to kids, not answered them?

Instead of just giving direct answers, what if an LLM was designed to ask **open-ended, curiosity-driven questions** to children — sparking their thinking, creativity, and reasoning?

## Why?
- Encourages deeper learning, not just quick answers
- Builds confidence in forming their own ideas
- Makes kids more comfortable with "not knowing" — and exploring anyway

## Dream Outcome
Someone saying:
> "Whoa, I love learning now — because this tool made me curious."

## Early Features (someday?)
- Age-adjusted question prompts
- Feedback based on their own thoughts
- Gamified "think quests"
- Safe, kind, and playful tone

## Notes
One day, I want to build this. Or something like it. Maybe with LLMs. Maybe with a team. But definitely for curious kids who just need a spark.
